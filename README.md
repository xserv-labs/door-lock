# Door Lock

We've connected our building's main door lock to Wi-Fi using
an [ESP8266 module](https://robu.in/product/esp8266-10a-dc-7-30v-network-relay-wifi-module/)
(it was already possible to put your hand inside and press the unlock-button, so security was already an illusion, it's
just more apparent now). This repository contains source code for the various interfaces that allow unlocking the door.
